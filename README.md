# Exercise
Use the dataset of Game, we have explored earlier and perform following operations.
Calculate the total global sales for all games in the dataset.
Find the game with the highest global sales.
Determine the average sales for each region (NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales).
Find the top 5 most popular game genres based on global sales.
Calculate the total sales for each genre in each region and find the most popular genre in North America (NA_Sales).
Display last 10 rows.
Determine the top 3 gaming platforms with the highest global sales.
Calculate the market share (percentage of global sales) for each genre.
Calculate the correlation coefficient between NA_Sales and EU_Sales. (.corr function)

# Task 2 English-Spanish Dictionary
You are creating a basic English-Spanish dictionary that allows users to look up English words and find their Spanish translations.
# Tasks
Create a dictionary where English words are keys and their Spanish translations are values.
Ask the user to input an English word.
Check if the word exists in the dictionary.
If the word exists, print its Spanish translation.
If the word does not exist, inform the user that the translation is not available.
Implement a loop that allows the user to keep looking up words until they choose to exit.

# Task 3 Email Classification
Develope a tool which will classify an email.
# Tasks:
Create a function classify_emails that takes a list of emails as an argument.
Inside the function, categorize emails into "Important," "Promotions," and "Spam" based on keywords and content analysis.
Loop through the emails and identify keywords to determine their category.
If an email contains keywords indicating importance, assign it as "Important."
If an email contains keywords related to promotions or deals, assign it as "Promotions."
If an email is suspected to be spam based on certain keywords or patterns, assign it as "Spam."
Return three lists of emails for each category.
Print the lists.

# Task 4 Online Store Shopping Cart
Write a Python program to simulate the online store's shopping cart system. The program should use a while loop to provide an interactive shopping experience.
# Tasks:
Initialize an empty list called shopping_cart to store items.
Display a welcome message and available products.
Loop should be iterating over AI Response Simulator and Investment decision and keep asking for user input.
Prompt the user to enter the number corresponding to the product they want to add to the cart.
Check if the user entered 'q'. If so, break the loop.
Convert the choice to an integer and validate it within the valid range (1 to 3).
Based on the user's choice, add the selected product to the shopping_cart list.
Display a confirmation message indicating the added product.
Continue the loop to allow the user to add more products or proceed to checkout.
After the loop ends, display the contents of the shopping cart.
Display a goodbye message.
End the program.
